# Euclidean-Rhythm
A python program designed to help musicians come up with complicated rhythms based on Euclid's Algorithm

Run with
  - python euc.py
  
You will be given three options:
  - Number of steps:      Corresponds to how many beats per rhythm.       EX) 16 beats per measure
  - Number of pulses:     Corresponds to how many beats will be played.   EX) 7 beats out of the 16 total
  - Number of rotations:  Corresponds to the shift in the pulses.         EX) We want to start playing the beats at these times.

Once you have specified your options, you will be presented with an image that respresents when to play each beat.

Use Case:
  - When creating music, use this to come up with cool new rhythms to spice up your music or to help come up with drum beats.
